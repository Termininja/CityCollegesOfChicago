***(Due: 21st Sept., 2013)***


**Task 01.** Write a program that inputs three integer from the user and displays the sum, average, product, and smallest and largest of the numbers.

**Task 02.** Write a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from `0` to `10` and displays the resulting values in table format. All calculations should be done in terms of a variable.

**Task 03.** Write a program `Ticket.cs` that will allow the user to enter actual speed limit, the speed limit at which the offender was travelling, and the number of previous tickets that person has received. The application should calculate and display how many miles over the speed limit the offender was travelling, the cost of the speeding ticket, and court cost. Use `$10.00` as the amount to be charged for each mile per hour over the speed limit. The court cost should begin at `$50.00` and increase by `$20.00` for each subsequent offense up to the third offense (that will represent the maximum court cost).
