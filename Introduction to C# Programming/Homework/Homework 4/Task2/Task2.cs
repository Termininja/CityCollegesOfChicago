/* Task 2: Create the class SavingsAccount. Use the static variable annualInterestRate to store the
 *         annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private
 *         instance variable savingsBalance, indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit.
 * 
 *         Provide method CalculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying
 *         the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12 — this interest should be added to
 *         savingsBalance.
 * 
 *         Provide static method ModifyInterestRate to set the annualInterestRate to a new value.
 * 
 *         Write an application to test class SavingsAccount. Create two savingsAccountobjects, saver1
 *         and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate
 *         to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and display the new balances for both savers.
 *         Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month’s interest and display
 *         the new balances for both savers.
